## Project Report Iteration 1

## Reflection
I really enjoyed doing research on "Juiceness" of games. I ended up added eyes to my coin to make my game a bit more interesting. But I also have been inspired on how to add a lot more juice to my games in the future. Before trying this I tried to work on the ludem dare project and I tried to make a game way to massive for the time period given, I now know my limits better.
